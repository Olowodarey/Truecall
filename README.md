# TrueCall

## Overview

**TrueCall** is a decentralized **prediction market platform** 

The project enables users to create and participate in prediction challenges in a transparent and trust-minimized way using smart contract technology.

## What is TrueCall?

TrueCall is a prediction platform that lets users:

✔ Participate in prediction challenges (such as sports results, price predictions, and other real-world events)
✔ Submit predictions directly on-chain using smart contracts

By leveraging decentralized infrastructure, TrueCall ensures transparency, security, and verifiable outcomes for all participants.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Prediction Market**
   Users can create prediction events with defined outcomes and timelines.

2. **Participate in Markets**
   Other users can join and submit their predictions before the deadline.

3. **On-Chain Submission**
   All predictions are recorded via smart contracts.

4. **Outcome Resolution**
   Once the event concludes, results are recorded and rewards are distributed according to the contract rules.

## Architecture

* Smart Contracts
* Web-based Frontend
* Modular backend infrastructure

## Goal

TrueCall aims to provide a decentralized and transparent environment where users can confidently participate in prediction markets without relying on centralized intermediaries, while remaining flexible across multiple blockchain ecosystems.
