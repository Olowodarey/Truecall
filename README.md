# TrueCall

## Overview

TrueCall is a decentralized multi-chain prediction market platform that allows users to participate in both standard prediction events and competitive leaderboard-based challenges. Users can submit predictions on real-world outcomes such as sports results, crypto prices, or other measurable events, all recorded transparently through smart contracts. In addition to regular markets, TrueCall introduces ranked competitions where participants earn points based on performance and compete on public leaderboards for top rewards. By combining prediction markets with gamified competition, TrueCall creates an engaging, transparent, and trust-minimized ecosystem where users can test their insights, compete globally, and earn based on accuracy.

## What is TrueCall?

TrueCall is a prediction platform that lets users:

✔ Participate in prediction challenges (such as sports results, price predictions, and other real-world events)
✔ Submit predictions directly on-chain using smart contracts

By leveraging decentralized infrastructure, TrueCall ensures transparency, security, and verifiable outcomes for all participants.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Prediction Market**
   Users can create prediction events with defined outcomes and timelines.

2. **Participate in Markets**
   Other users can join and submit their predictions before the deadline.

3. **On-Chain Submission**
   All predictions are recorded via smart contracts.

4. **Outcome Resolution**
   Once the event concludes, results are recorded and rewards are distributed according to the contract rules.

## Architecture

* Smart Contracts
* Web-based Frontend
* Modular backend infrastructure

## Goal

TrueCall aims to provide a decentralized and transparent environment where users can confidently participate in prediction markets without relying on centralized intermediaries, while remaining flexible across multiple blockchain ecosystems.
